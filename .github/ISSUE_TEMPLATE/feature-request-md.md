**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
The current Sudoku Solver implementation is functional but lacks interactive features that could enhance user experience. Users must input puzzles in a fixed format and view results in a static manner. This limits usability and makes the tool less engaging for those who prefer visual and interactive elements.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
I propose adding a graphical user interface (GUI) to the Sudoku Solver. This GUI would allow users to:

Input Sudoku puzzles interactively using a grid interface.
View real-time solving progress with visual feedback.
Generate new Sudoku puzzles of varying difficulty levels.
Validate puzzles and provide hints if needed.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
An alternative is to enhance the existing command-line interface (CLI) by adding more features like validation and hint generation without a GUI. While this approach could improve functionality, it may not be as user-friendly or engaging as a GUI.

**Additional context**
Incorporating a GUI would make the Sudoku Solver more accessible and enjoyable for users, especially those who are not familiar with command-line tools. It would also serve as a practical demonstration of integrating algorithmic solutions with interactive user interfaces, potentially attracting a wider audience and providing a richer user experience.
